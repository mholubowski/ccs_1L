Kinnly - CCS 1L
===============

## Abstract
> A **private & simple *Instagram* ** for my family

My project will require the design and development of a **native iOS application** which speaks to a **Ruby on Rails back end**.

`Kinnly` will be driven by the sole goal of creating something **my family** (not tech savvy) uses daily to share photos and stay in touch.

The primary challenges involve: learning the Objective-C programming language, understanding native iOS development, and developing a secure and efficient RESTful api for consumption by mobile devices.


## My Motivation's
My parents have recently become both iPhone users and empty nesters. I'll have immediate beta users who I care about.

- **Kinnly's success will be measured solely by my family's adoption of it**

Additionally, this project aligns perfectly with my goals as a software engineer and student:

- Continue exploring RESTful design, Ruby, Javascript, and Rails
- Learn more about SQL, deployment, caching, and API design (I'm also taking CS290B)
- Break into something entirely new with Objective-C, iOS, mobile consumption of API


## High-level milestones
- Objective-C
- Cocoa
- iOS development best practices

- Rails back end
- API consumption
    - authentication (see reference)
- Image upload, processing, storage (s3), and efficient retrieval
